        <p class="song2"><b>Shankar Shanmugam (born 17 August 1963), credited as S. Shankar or his mononym Shankar, is an Indian film director, film producer and screenwriter who works predominantly in Tamil cinema. He is one of the highest grossing film directors in Indian cinema.[2] His films typically deal with the contemporary social issues, vigilante themes and the usage of state of the art technology and VFX. He has won one National Film Award, four Filmfare Award South and six Tamil Nadu State Film Awards in his career. Six of his films have won the National Film Award for Best Special Effects.

            He made his debut as a director in the film Gentleman (1993), for which he won the Filmfare Best Director Award and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Director. He usually collaborates with composer A. R. Rahman, both having done over 11 films together. Two of his films Indian (1996) and Mudhalvan (1999), which deal with social and political issues, were commercially very successful and also submitted by India for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but neither earned a nomination. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by M. G. R. University. </b></p>
