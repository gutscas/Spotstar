He was a recipient of a Tamil Nadu State Film Award, four Edison Awards, four SIIMA Awards, and two other Vijay AwardDuring college, Sivakarthikeyan took part in various cultural events and performed mimicry and standup comedy onstage. Between his studies, he took a three month-break, and during this period, his friends convinced him to go for auditions of Kalakka Povathu Yaaru?, a comedy reality TV show airing on Star Vijay. He started his career as a mimicry artist. Despite initial reluctance to participate, he won the show. He appeared in short films, including his friend Atlee's Mugapputhagam,[8] Identity, Kurahl 786, and 360Â°. The makers of Aegan noticed Sivakarthikeyan and offered him a supporting role in the film, but his portions did not make the final cut.</b></p>
